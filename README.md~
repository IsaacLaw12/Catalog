DESCRIPTION:
This is a flask powered website built for the Udacity Full Stack Web Development Menu App course

The three functions of this webapp are:

1. Provide an interface and database for users to manage restaurants and their menus

2. Implement Oauth logins in order to protect user's restaurant creations

3. Compile JSON files to simplify data exports

######## Running it yourself ##############

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREQUESITES:
To use this app Python, SqlAlchemy, Flask, and Oauth2client need to all be installed on your computer.

The fastest way to be up and running is to install vagrant and run Udacity's virtual machine with all necessary modules already setup and ready to use:

https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud197/install-vagrant

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETUP:
Once the necessary python modules are installed on your system the program is ready to go.

Navigate to this folder in your terminal and type "python database_setup.py" for the one time database setup.

To run the server type "python final_project.py" and navigate to "http://localhost:5000" to start using the system
(The server also runs on "http://127.0.0.1:5000", but the linked OAuth authenticators only recognize login requests from localhost:5000)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USE: 
You can begin creating restaurants and menus as soon as you've logged in with either google or facebook.  (There is also an option for Amazon that is not yet functional)
Once you've logged in a restaurant can be created from the restaurants home page, and then menu items can be added to the new restaurant. As long as you are the owner of a restaurant there will also be options to edit and delete menu items and restaurants.

If you want a JSON object that describes your restaurant there are three functions available:

1. /restaurant/JSON/                                  returns all restaurants and their id's

2. /restaurant/<restaurant_id>/menu/JSON              returns a specific restaurants menu

3. /restaurant/<restaurant_id>/menu/<menu id>/JSON    returns a specific menu item
